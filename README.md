# lotterysol

Ethereum Lottery Dapp built using solidity &amp; node.js, and deployed to Rinkby test network.

The contract accepts entry fees of over 0.01 ether, and allows the manager to have the contract pick a psuedo-random winner who receives all proceeds.

Feel free to play with the deployed lottery contract by:
- Going to remix solidity editor at - https://remix.ethereum.org
- Pasting in the Lottery contract code from Lottery.sol
- Run an 'injected web3 instance', at address 0xa932EEb44887b67E1645A53CA2F91d6662A7F8f9

Enjoy ;)
